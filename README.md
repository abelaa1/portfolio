##  About Me

I am a results-driven and client-focused solutions engineer with 3+ years of experience designing, developing, and deploying innovative solutions within the Google advertising ecosystem as a Customer Solutions Engineer. Proven ability to bridge the gap between complex technical concepts and non-technical stakeholders, consistently exceeding client expectations. I recently completed a Master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I also hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Southern California, with a minor in Cybersecurity. I am currently seeking opportunities to leverage my advanced technical skills and passion for cutting-edge technology to contribute to impactful solutions at Google. Prior experience includes a role as a Technical Solutions Engineer at Google, specializing in network troubleshooting and cloud infrastructure.

Current Role

As a Customer Solution Engineer since October 2023, I've been the primary technical contact for advertiser clients, designing and delivering solutions for their unique advertising needs. This involves everything from meeting with clients to understand their challenges, to developing and implementing solutions using various coding languages and frameworks like Python, Apps Script, JavaScript, and BigQuery. I'm responsible for managing the entire project lifecycle, from initial discovery to final delivery, ensuring projects meet deadlines and adhere to documentation standards. A key part of my role is making complex technical concepts accessible to non-technical clients. I build all solutions on Google Cloud Platform, provide ongoing support, and eventually transfer ownership to the client's internal engineering teams
